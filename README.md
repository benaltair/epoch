# Epoch
This is an idea at this early stage; an experiment. A website which shows a chronology of the events of the Baha'i Faith throughout history, connecting users to relevant guidance along this timeline.

## Principles
This will be developed to run on a serverless architecture, using a jamstack methodology. The data will be hosted in a headless CMS and structured logically, with the build process ideally producing a statically generated website.

## Contributing
If you find this, you are welcome to submit issues, PRs, or contact the contributors with ideas. This may go nowhere, but it is started at this point.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
